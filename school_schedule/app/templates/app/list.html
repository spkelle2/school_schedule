	<p> Welcome to School Schedules! Click the Excel link to download
	the form. </p>
	<p> Once open, move the x's in the "Availabilities" sheet to the times
	each of your students are available as well as when you would like
	to have planning period and lunch. Then on the "Requirements" sheet,
	specify how many periods you must meet with each student, plan, or eat.
	</p>
	<p> Feel free to add or remove students and/or times on the
	"Availabilities" sheet by changing the number of filled in rows
	or columns. If you change the number of students, be sure to add/remove
        them and the number of times you must meet with them on the
        "Requirements" sheet.</p>
	<p>Once you are finished, save the excel form. Select it to upload via
	the "Choose File" button below. Once you choose it, you can hit
	"Upload" to send it to the scheduler. The scheduler will automatically
	have your computer download the solution when it is done. Open the
	returned excel file to the "Solution" sheet to find your schedule
	solved!</p>
